description: At Bard College I worked on a cost-effective direct laser writing (DLW) system for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. The system coupled a standard fluorescence microscope, a 3-axis stage, and a UV laser to generate complex patterns with high precision. To make the system as user friendly as possible I programmed a custom user interface for pattern design and machine calibration.

achievements:
  - Helped develop the school's first DLW system within a tight budget.
  - Created a powerful user interface that greatly simplified pattern generation and execution.
  - Helped students utilize the system for their school projects and theses.
