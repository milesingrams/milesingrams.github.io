position: Microdevice Design Engineer

tags: [ Bits, Bots, Bio ]

description: As a microdevice design engineer at the Wyss Institute I worked within the Organs-on-Chips project to design and fabricate plastic fluidic microchips for culturing human organ tissues. The microchips enabled tissue culture with unparalleled fidelity by utilizing complex microstructures and bio-coatings that mimic the cellular environment in the body. Ultimately the microchips could be used to accelerate the drug development process by providing a more accurate model of human organ tissues.

achievements:
  - Made major design improvements to the microchips allowing for improved cellular compatibility and experimentation throughput.
  - Overhauled multiple aspects of the fabrication process to greatly improve fabrication efficiency and yield.
  - Designed a specialized quality control tracking application that allowed for a data driven design iteration process.
