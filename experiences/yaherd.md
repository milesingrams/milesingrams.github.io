description: YaHerd is an event planning web app that allows you to organize your friends whether or not they have Facebook. I created it because many of my friends left Facebook for privacy concerns, leading to the absurd situation of texting them screenshots of upcoming Facebook events I was planning. With YaHerd you can have an attractive and streamlined event planning experience, no account necessary.
