description: YaHerd is an event planning web app that allows you to organize your friends whether or not they have Facebook. I created it because many of my friends left Facebook over privacy concerns, leading to the absurd situation of texting them screenshots of upcoming Facebook events I was planning. With YaHerd you can have an attractive and streamlined event planning experience, no account necessary.

achievements:
  - Combined my full-stack development expertise with my brothers design / UX expertise to build the application from the ground up.
  - Developed the application to be massively scalable using a combination of cutting-edge server and cloud-based technologies.
  - Managed all aspects of domain setup and application hosting / deployment.
