position: Systems Engineer

tags: [ Bits, Bots ]

description: As a systems engineer at the Wyss Institute I worked within the Organs-on-Chips project to develop a robotic platform for human tissue culture and experimentation. The robot was designed to automatically perform the complex liquid handling, climate control, and imaging tasks necessary for culturing human organ tissue within microfluidic devices. Additionally, I built a web-based user interface to plan, schedule, and remotely manage simultaneous experiments on multiple robots.

achievements:
  - Led all aspects of robot design, development, and construction.
  - Went through multiple design iterations to optimize for robot functionality, user-friendliness, and long-term stability.
  - Worked closely with our biology team to design the robotic platform and user interface to synergize with their preferred workflows.
